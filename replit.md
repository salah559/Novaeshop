## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework: Next.js 13 (Pages Router)**
- **Rationale**: Chosen for server-side rendering capabilities, API routes, and seamless TypeScript integration
- **Routing**: Traditional pages directory structure for straightforward routing
- **State Management**: React hooks with local state, no global state management library
- **Data Fetching**: SWR for client-side data fetching with automatic revalidation

**UI Approach**
- Custom CSS (globals.css) with inline styling and comprehensive media queries
- No UI framework/library - lightweight custom components
- Bilingual interface (Arabic/English) with Arabic as primary language
- **Fully responsive design** using CSS clamp(), auto-fit grids, and mobile-first breakpoints
- Mobile navigation with animated hamburger menu (< 768px)
- Fluid typography and spacing that scales from 320px to 4K displays
- Touch-optimized controls (minimum 44px tap targets on mobile)

### Backend Architecture

**Firebase Integration (Dual Mode)**

1. **Client-Side (Browser)**
   - Firebase SDK v9 modular approach
   - Authentication: Google OAuth and Email/Password
   - Firestore for real-time data operations
   - Storage for file uploads (receipts, product files)

2. **Server-Side (API Routes)**
   - Firebase Admin SDK for privileged operations
   - Service account authentication
   - Secure order confirmation and purchase creation
   - Signed URL generation for protected file downloads

**API Routes Structure**
- `/api/admin/list-orders`: Fetch pending orders for admin review
- `/api/admin/confirm-order`: Process payment confirmation and create purchases

### Data Architecture

**Firestore Collections**

1. **products**
   - Fields: name, description, price, category, imageUrl, filePath/fileUrl
   - Stores digital product catalog

2. **orders**
   - Fields: userId, items[], total, paymentImageUrl, email, status, createdAt
   - Tracks purchase orders with payment receipts
   - Status: 'pending' â†’ 'confirmed'

3. **purchases**
   - Fields: userId, productId, name, downloadUrl, createdAt
   - Created after admin confirms payment
   - Provides download access to purchased products

4. **messages**
   - Fields: name, email, message, fileUrl, createdAt
   - Contact form submissions with optional attachments

**Storage Strategy**
- `/receipts/`: Payment receipt images uploaded by customers
- `/messages/`: Contact form attachments
- Product files: Referenced by filePath, served via signed URLs

### Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Methods**
- Google OAuth via Firebase Authentication
- Email/Password registration and login
- Session management via Firebase onAuthStateChanged

**Authorization Pattern**
- Client-side: Auth state determines UI visibility
- Server-side: Admin operations use Firebase Admin SDK
- No role-based access control (assumes trusted admin access)

### Payment Flow

**Manual Payment Processing**
1. User adds products to cart (localStorage)
2. User uploads payment receipt image to checkout
3. Order created in Firestore with 'pending' status
4. Admin reviews receipt in admin panel
5. Admin confirms â†’ System creates purchase records with download URLs
6. User accesses downloads in "My Purchases" section

**Design Decision**: Manual payment verification chosen to accommodate local payment methods (Baridi Mob) not supported by standard payment processors

### File Delivery System

**Product Download Mechanism**
- Products store filePath reference in Firestore
- On order confirmation, Firebase Storage generates time-limited signed URLs (24-hour expiry)
- Signed URLs stored in purchases collection for user access
- Alternative: Direct fileUrl if product uses external hosting

## External Dependencies

**Firebase (Primary Backend)**
- **Authentication**: User identity management (Google OAuth, Email/Password)

**Environment Variables Required**

### Deployment Platform

- Development server configured with workflow
- Autoscale deployment for production (stateless web app)
- Firebase credentials stored securely in Replit Secrets
